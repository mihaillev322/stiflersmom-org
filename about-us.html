<h1>About this Stiflers Mom fan site and editorial approach</h1>

<section id="mission">
<h2>Mission and scope</h2>
<p>This independent fan site is dedicated to documenting the Stiflers Mom character from the American Pie film franchise, exploring her role within the ensemble cast, and examining the cultural impact of one of comedy cinema's most memorable figures. Our mission is to provide an accessible, international editorial resource that contextualises the character's place in 90s and early 2000s comedy films while maintaining rigorous standards of accuracy, sourcing, and respectful analysis.</p>

<p>The scope of this <a href="/">Stiflers Mom character guide</a> is deliberately focused: we examine the character's function as a comedic catalyst, the memorable movie moments that defined her legacy, and the ways in which quotes and references have circulated through popular culture. We do not reproduce copyrighted script material verbatim, nor do we host explicit content. Instead, we approach the subject with the analytical distance of film commentary, treating the character as a cultural artefact worthy of serious consideration within the history of American comedy cinema.</p>

<p>Our editorial boundaries are clear. This site does not claim any affiliation with the American Pie production studios, cast members, or rights holders. We are a fan-created resource that relies on publicly available information, critical commentary, and established film scholarship. Where we discuss scenes, quotes, or character interactions, we do so at a high level, focusing on comedic structure, timing, and cultural reception rather than explicit detail. Our goal is to serve readers who are interested in understanding why this character became iconic, how she fits into the broader landscape of comedy film history, and what her lasting influence tells us about audience tastes and genre evolution.</p>

<p>We recognise that the Stiflers Mom character exists within a specific comedic tradition, one that has been both celebrated and critiqued over the years. Our approach is to document that tradition objectively, acknowledging the character's popularity while also providing context about the era in which the films were made. We link to authoritative sources throughout the site, including encyclopedic references, film institute resources, and academic commentary on comedy cinema. For readers seeking answers to common questions about the character, cast, and franchise, we invite you to explore our <a href="/faq">FAQ on Stiflers Mom scenes and quotes</a>.</p>

<p>This site is designed for an international readership. We use British English spelling and grammar conventions, and we explain cultural references and film industry terminology that may not be familiar to all visitors. Our commitment is to plain language, clear structure, and accessible design, ensuring that readers from diverse backgrounds can engage with the content comfortably and confidently.</p>

<section id="standards">
<h2>Sourcing and editorial standards</h2>
<p>Every claim made on this site is grounded in verifiable sources. We prioritise established encyclopedic references, major news outlets, film institute publications, and academic commentary on cinema history. Where information is drawn from fan communities or social media, we clearly label it as such and do not present it as authoritative fact. Our editorial process involves cross-referencing multiple sources before publishing any statement about cast details, production history, or cultural impact.</p>

<p>The following table outlines our sourcing framework and verification methods:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Topic</th>
<th>Preferred sources</th>
<th>Verification method</th>
<th>Update cadence</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Cast and crew details</td>
<td>Wikipedia, IMDb, major news archives</td>
<td>Cross-reference at least two independent sources</td>
<td>Annually or when new information emerges</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Film history and context</td>
<td>Britannica, BFI, academic journals</td>
<td>Cite authoritative film scholarship</td>
<td>Biennially or as scholarship updates</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<p>We maintain a corrections policy: if a reader identifies an error, we investigate promptly and update the content with a timestamped note. Corrections are logged in our internal editorial records, and significant changes are reflected in the page metadata. We do not silently alter content; transparency is a core value of our editorial practice.</p>

<p>External authority links are chosen with care. We link to resources such as the <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">British Film Institute</a> for film history context, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_criticism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia articles on film criticism</a> for overviews of analytical approaches, and major news archives for interviews and retrospective coverage. These links are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain active and relevant.</p>

<section id="accessibility">
<h2>Accessibility and international readership</h2>
<p>This site is built with accessibility as a foundational principle. We use semantic HTML5 elements to ensure that screen readers and assistive technologies can parse the content correctly. All navigation elements are keyboard-accessible, and we provide visible focus indicators with sufficient contrast to meet WCAG AA standards. Our colour palette has been tested for contrast ratios, with text meeting or exceeding 4.5:1 against background colours.</p>

<p>Typography is responsive and scales smoothly across devices. We use the CSS clamp function to ensure that text remains readable on screens ranging from mobile phones to large desktop monitors. Line heights and paragraph spacing are optimised for readability, and we avoid justified text alignment to prevent uneven word spacing that can hinder comprehension.</p>

<aside>
<h3>Accessibility features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keyboard navigation:</strong> All interactive elements are reachable via Tab key, with logical focus order.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced motion:</strong> Users with prefers-reduced-motion enabled will experience no animations or transitions.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic structure:</strong> Headings follow a logical hierarchy, and landmarks are clearly defined.</li>
<li><strong>Plain language:</strong> We avoid jargon and explain film industry terms when they are necessary.</li>
</ul>
</aside>

<p>For international readers, we provide context for cultural references that may be specific to American cinema or 1990s popular culture. We use British English spelling and grammar, but we aim for clarity and simplicity that transcends regional variations. Our goal is to ensure that a reader in London, Lagos, or Lima can engage with the content without encountering unnecessary barriers.</p>

<p>We do not use JavaScript for core functionality, ensuring that the site remains fully usable even in environments where scripting is disabled or unavailable. The only JavaScript on the site is structured data markup for search engines, which does not affect the user experience.</p>

<section id="contact">
<h2>Contact and corrections</h2>
<p>We welcome feedback, corrections, and suggestions from readers. If you have identified an error in our content, have a question about our sourcing, or wish to suggest an improvement, please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:editorial@stiflersmom.org">editorial@stiflersmom.org</a>. We aim to respond to all substantive inquiries within one week.</p>

<p>Our corrections policy is straightforward: if we have published inaccurate information, we will correct it promptly and note the correction in the page content. For minor typographical errors, we update silently. For factual errors that could mislead readers, we add a timestamped correction note at the end of the relevant section. We do not delete or obscure our mistakes; we believe that transparency builds trust.</p>

<p>Updates to the site are logged internally, and major revisions are reflected in the page metadata. We review all content annually to ensure that links remain active, that information is current, and that our editorial standards continue to meet best practices in digital publishing.</p>

<p>This site is a labour of appreciation for a character who has left an indelible mark on comedy cinema. We are committed to maintaining it as a reliable, respectful, and accessible resource for fans, researchers, and curious readers around the world.</p>
